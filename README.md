##Project's Main Idea:

		In our fast-paced world, it's not easy to connect with people who share our interests, passions,
	and goals. Despite the convenience of technology and social media, people often feel lonely
	and isolated, and traditional social media platforms may not be the best places to find likeminded
	individuals since it is still the user's responsibility to seek them out.
		That's why we want to create VOYN, an Android application that simplifies the process of finding like-minded individuals.
	VOYN will match users based on three main categories: transportation, sports, and
	accommodation.
		As an example of its transportation benefits, individuals with similar routes
	can connect and split the cost of transportation while sharing the experience. Similarly, in
	sports, people can come together to create teams and find partners with ease. Furthermore, individuals
	with a desire to live in the same location can easily connect.
		VOYN can help you connect with people who share your interests and goals, so you never have to feel alone again.
